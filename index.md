Hi, I'm {col-primary}`Angus`.

I'm an open-source software developer, research physicist, and mediocre guitarist.

With a long-standing passion for problem-solving and exploration, I am driven by finding ways to improve the world around me.

I have a deep breadth of experience, and always welcome new challenges. Feel free to drop me a line at angus@oieltd.com
